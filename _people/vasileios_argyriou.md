description: I received a BSc degree in computer science from Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece, in 2001 and the MSc and PhD degrees from the University of Surrey, in 2003 and 2006, respectively, both in electrical engineering working on registration. I joined the Communications and Signal Processing (CSP) Department, Imperial College, London, in 2007 where I was a Research Fellow working on 3D object reconstruction. Now, I am a Professor at Kingston University working on computer vision and AI.
